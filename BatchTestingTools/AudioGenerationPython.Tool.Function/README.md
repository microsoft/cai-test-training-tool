# Setup

## Operations
The section below describes the frameworks to be installed locally before you can get started testing, debugging and deploying the service.

### Local Installation
First, you have to install/set up following components:
1. PowerShell
    - [Azure Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), command line tools for Azure using PowerShell
    - [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=windows%2Ccsharp%2Cbash#v2), download for your local runtime environment, e.g. as `.exe` -> _v3.x: Windows 64-Bit_
    - A restart is highly recommended or even required after installing these components, otherwise you might face some hiccups.
2. Python >= 3.8
    - We recommend you to use the official version from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/), make sure you install `pip` and set Python as `path` variable during the installation
3. Postman
    - Framework for API testing, download it [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

### Testing and Debugging
1. Get your code from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/cai-test-training-tool` and `cd` into folder `BatchTestingTools/AudioGenerationPython.Tool.Function/`
1. Create a virtual environment: `python â€“m venv .venv`
1. Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate` (Linux) or `.venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows), type `deactivate` to disable it again if needed
1. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Set your keys (only for local development and debugging) in the `config.ini` (they are needed for the Speech requests)
1. For debugging and local testing, open a separate PowerShell window and execute `func start --verbose` in the root folder of the function. This enables you to do code changes during runtime without shutting down the function completely when there is an issue
1. Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for testing the endpoints using the localhost request of this [collection](assets/postman_collection/looky_localhost.postman_collection.json)

### Deployment to Azure
1. Open your PowerShell
1. Activate your environment, if you haven't before: <br>
`source .venv/bin/activate` (Linux) or `.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1` (Windows)
1. Login to your Azure Account: `az login` (a browser window will open, where you may have to log on Azure)
1. Execute the command below:<br> 
`func azure functionapp publish [insert your function name] --remote build`
1. Wait until the deployment is finished
1. (optional, only has to be done for initial deployment OR when settings are updated) Execute following command:<br>
`az webapp config appsettings set -g [insert name of resource group] -n [insert your function name] --settings "@appsettings.json"`
1. Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for testing the endpoints with the [collections](assets/postman-collection/xxxx.json)

#### Google
The Google authentication-json cannot be inserted into the KeyVault directly, which is why a small detour is necessary.

For this, follow these steps:
- Open a PowerShell and login with az login
- Change directory to the respective location of the auth.json
- az keyvault secret set --vault-name "<keyvaultname" --name "CockpitGoogleAuth" --description "Google TTS Authentication" --file .\auth.json

For Google, you will have to set one key in the App Settings of the Function:
- GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_STORE
